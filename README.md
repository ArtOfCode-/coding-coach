## UX DESIGN
Follow instructions in `dev` branch for cloning the entire repo and familiarize yourself with guidelines for contributing.

Make sure you make all your design contributions in the design branch:
`$ git checkout design`

Use [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/) for creating diagrams, save them to your Google Drive and set the sharing to 'Anyone with the link can comment'. Save your diagram locally as `.jpg` and move it to `jpg` folder in this branch.

Submit your designs in the UX folder as a `.md` files with a descriptive title (ex. `SignIn.md`), a link to your diagram, and the `.jpg` image of your diagram.

Cheatsheet for `.md` syntax [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

#### NOTE: PRs
Create your pull requests directly with `design` branch, not with `dev` branch. Pull requests in this branch should not be merged with development.
